            Here's a generic <code>p</code> element.
            It will be red
        </p>
        <p class="group">
            Here's a <code>p</code> element with a <code>class</code> of <code>group</code>. 
            There are two rules that apply, but since the <code>p.group</code> rule is more specific, 
            this paragraph will be blue.
        </p>
        <p id="last" class="group">
            Here's a <code>p</code> element with an <code>id</code> of <code>intro</code>. 
            There are four rules that could apply to this paragraph. The first two are overruled by the more 
            specific last two. The position breaks the tie between the last two: the one that appears later 
            wins, and thus this paragraph will be magenta.
